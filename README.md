Hybrid Deep Learning Technique for Heart Disease Prediction
This project presents an advanced hybrid deep learning framework for heart disease prediction that integrates Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with Random Forest (RF) — forming a hybrid RF–ANN model (HRFANN). The approach leverages the strengths of both ensemble learning and deep neural networks to improve prediction accuracy and generalizability.The system is trained and evaluated on multiple datasets (Kaggle, UCI, GitHub), featuring preprocessing steps such as data normalization, encoding, and missing value imputation. Performance is assessed using key metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Key Features:
Multi-source dataset integration for robust generalization 
Hybrid RF–ANN model for improved predictive performance
Comprehensive preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline
Comparative analysis with classical ML and standalone DL models
Visualization of training results and evaluation metrics

Tech Stack:
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Objective:
To enhance the accuracy and reliability of heart disease prediction systems using a hybrid deep learning approach that mitigates bias and improves generalization across diverse datasets.
