# Hybrid-Deep-Learning-Technique-for-Heart-Disease-Prediction-
This project presents a Hybrid Deep Learning Model (HRFANN) combining Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network to predict heart disease with high accuracy. It integrates multiple datasets for better generalization and reduced bias. The system enhances diagnostic reliability and supports AI-driven early detection in healthcare.
